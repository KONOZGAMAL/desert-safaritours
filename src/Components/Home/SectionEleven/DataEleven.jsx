    It’s your wish; there are no such specifications. Still, we want you to
    enjoy the experience at its fullest. So, we would recommend you to wear
    relaxing clothing. To start with, you may wear comfortable trousers, a hat,
    sunglasses, etc. Sunscreen and lotions would be really helpful. In short,
    use adjustable and looser clothes (breathable) which can be suitable for
    both cold and hot temperatures. Remember you will be on dunes and avoid
    clothes that would make you carry and deposit dust wherever you walk.
